The IPython Notebooks in this directory generate forcing files for 2D domain.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Generate_2D_T+S.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/notebooks/Generate_2D_T+S.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook generates a 2D initial condition file for the 2D domain.  

* ##[Testing 2D mesh.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/notebooks/Testing 2D mesh.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook tests the 2D mesh generated by a test run of nemo with bathy2D.nc  
      
    Bathy: /data/nsoontie/MEOPAR/2Ddomain/bathy2D.nc (Generate_2D_bthy.ipynb)  
      
    Configuration: /data/nsoontie/MEOPAR/NEMO-code-2D/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/SalishSea2D  
      
    The mesh_mask.nc file was generated with a failed run of the nemo.exe built with the SalishSea2D configuration and the bathymetry file set as bathy2D.nc  


* ##[Generate_2D_Tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/notebooks/Generate_2D_Tides.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook generates a tidal forcing for 2D domain.  

* ##[Generate_rivers_forcing.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/notebooks/Generate_rivers_forcing.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook to generate a river forcing. Constant Fraser river outflow 2000m^3/s.  
      
    Based on /data/nsoontie/MEOPAR/NEMO-forcing/rivers/Fraser_only_cnst.nc  
      


* ##[Generate_2D_bathy.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/notebooks/Generate_2D_bathy.ipynb)  
    
    The notebook will generate a two-dimensional bathymetry along the thalweg for simulation runs.  
      
    Two-dimensional simulations will allow us to quickly experiment with changes in resolution, mxing parameters etc
