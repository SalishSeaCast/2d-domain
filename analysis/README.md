    This notebook will develop a procudure for defining a Froude number.  


* ##[Compare Froude.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/analysis/Compare Froude.ipynb)  
    
    A notebook to compare the Froude number between 2d and 3D runs.   

* ##[CompareVerticalRes-trpl_tanh.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/2d-domain/raw/tip/analysis/CompareVerticalRes-trpl_tanh.ipynb)
