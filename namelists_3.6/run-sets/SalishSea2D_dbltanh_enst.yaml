# salishsea command processor run description example for NEMO-3.6
#
# Salish Sea 2D domain with:
#   S4-1 uniform initial T and S
#   Open, unstructured left boundary
#     Tidal forcing
#     Masson-based T+S
#  Rivers run-off forcing - constant dishcarge at right end
#  Constant windstress applied at surface

config_name: SalishSea2D

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i (longitude) and j (latitude) directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
MPI decomposition: 3x5
